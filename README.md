# Insult Censorship Bot
   A Discord bot to censor any bad things people say about you.  
  
  >"Your message has been found containing objectively incorrect information. I have done you the favor of removing it!" -Censorship Bot

  Censorship Bot is a bot I created in order to stop people from bullying me. Unfortunately, the Tensorflow.js model I used to detect insults does a poor job at detecting any slightly creative insults. It does a good job at detecting really simple insults though.

## Setup
  
  1. Download the code from this repository with one of the following
     - Clone this repository using git
     - Download the .zip for this repo
       -If you use this method, be sure to extract the contents from the folder to the desired location
      
  2. Create a new discord bot, or open an existing one
     - Go to the [Discord Developers Application Page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application
   
  3. Edit the required JSONs
     - Input the token of your bot into token.json
     - Input any ways that you want the bot to identify you in sentances, such as names, nicknames and such
      
  4. Open Command line and start the program
     - Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your system, or the program will not run
     - Change your directory to the program folder that you installed
     - run "node ." in the command line

  Congratulations, you are now safe from words on a screen.
